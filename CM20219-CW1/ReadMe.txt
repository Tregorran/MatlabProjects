Each file contains all the files needed for each question

6.1 Basic convolution
 > open "6.1 basic convolution" contains "tests.m" + "basic_convolution.m"
 > copy files into "Documents - MATLAB"
 - run "tests.m" to display functionality
 
6.2 Border handling
 > open "6.2 border handling"
 > copy files into "Documents - MATLAB"
 - run "tests.m" to display functionality
 
 6.3 Image filtering
 > open "6.3 image filtering"
 > copy files into "Documents - MATLAB"
 - run "image_filtering.m" to display functionality
 - (takes a bit of time to display)
 - displays the gaussian kernel's sum in the command window
 
 6.4 Exploiting the convolution theorem
 > open "6.4 exploiting the convolution theorem"
 > copy files into "Documents - MATLAB"
 - run "tests.m" to display functionality of the convolution theorem
 - run "tickTockTest.m" to show run-time comparisons in the command window
 
 7.1 Compound transform
 > open "7.1 compound transform"
 > copy files into "Documents - MATLAB"
 - run "rotate2D.m" to dislay the square rotating on the point
 - change the variable "point" to change where the point and square is located
 
 7.2 Post-multiplication
 > open "7.2 post-multiplication"
 > copy files into "Documents - MATLAB"
 - run "rotate2DTranspose.m" to display the square rotating on the point
 - change the variable "point" to change where the point and square is located
 
 7.3 Articulated motion
 > open "7.3 acticulated motion"
 > copy files into "Documents - MATLAB"
 - run "earthMoon.m" to display the 2 moons rotating around the earth and another
	moon rotating around one of the other moon
	
 7.4 Estimating transformations
 > open "7.4 estimating transformations"
 > copy files into "Documents - MATLAB"
 - run "transforms.m" to display the Fs
 
 8.1 Forward and backward warping
 > open "8.1 forward and backward warping"
 > copy files into "Documents - MATLAB"
 - run "backwardmap.m" to display backward mapped mona 
   in a different transformation 
 
 8.2 Linear interpolation
 > open "8.2 linear interpolation"
 > copy files into "Documents - MATLAB"
 - run "bilinear_interpolation.m" to show bilinearly interpolated mona
 
 8.3 Lens undistortion
 > open "8.3 lens undistortion"
 > copy files into "Documents - MATLAB"
 - run "lens_undistortion.m" to show the undistorted window
 
 8.4 Homographies
 > open "8.4 homographies"
 > copy files into "Documents - MATLAB"
 - run "homogdemo.m" to show the windows
 - choose 4 points in the left image and 4 in the right image that are the same
 - choose another 4 points in the left image
 - displays the corresponding 4 points in the right image
 - "don't have to delete the matrix "mymatrix" can be used for 8.5"
 
 8.5 Image alignment
 > open "8.5 image alignment"
 > copy files into "Documents - MATLAB"
 - if you already have a matrix don't have copy in "mymatrix"
 - if needed "homogdemo.m" to create a matrix to be used
 - run "image_alignment.m" to show the image alignment
